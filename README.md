# BG3ods
These are the source files for the 30+ mods I created for Baldur's Gate 3 and posted on Nexus prior to official mod support. I have no desire to rework them in the new format being used by the official mod manager, but I have received a number of requests to do so, especially from console users.

As such, I am posting these here for any enterprising modder to fork and take over in order to make the conversion and handle the publication of them as you wish. They belong to the world now.
