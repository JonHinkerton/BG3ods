These are the source files for the 30+ mods I created for Baldur's Gate 3 and posted on Nexus prior to official mod support. I have no desire to rework them in the new format being used by the official mod manager, but I have received a number of requests to do so, especially from console users.

As such, I am posting these here for any enterprising modder to fork and take over in order to make the conversion and handle the publication of them as you wish. They belong to the world now.

If you do make anythiing from these, drop me a note and let me know, I'll always be curious where they wind up.

Developer notes: The script file in each of the pet summon mods is there to prevent multiple copies of a summon being made by different party members. It's not essential functionality.  If you want to make the mod not reliant on the SE, just pull out the scripts folder.
